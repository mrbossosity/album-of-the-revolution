        article: "<p>“Name me someone who's ridiculous, Dannie.<br><i>Governor Faubus!</i><br>Why is he so sick and ridiculous?<br><i>He won't permit us in his schools!</i><br>Then he's a fool!<br>Oh, boo!”</p><p>The lyrics to Charles Mingus’s 1959 tune “Fables of Faubus” never aired because Columbia Records refused to publish the song in its original form. Mingus recorded the piece again in 1960 with an independent label to make his scathing, satirical critique of the Ku Klux Klan and the Little Rock integration crisis heard.</p><p>“Fables” may have been an exceptionally political song for Mingus, but jazz has always been inherently political for the generations of Black practitioners upon whose shoulders the discipline rests. To that end, American popular music (read: music of the African diaspora) has consistently served as a crucial channel for Black activism spanning an array of genres and more than a century of history. For instance, Kendrick Lamar’s 2015 hip-hop anthem “Alright” was groundbreaking for the modern movement for Black lives, but critic Giovanni Russonello reminds us that the saxophone licks and rough vocals on the chorus beat descend from a long tradition of protest jazz and weaponizing the academy to demand justice (<a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/03/arts/music/jazz-protest-academia.html'>NYT 2020</a>).<p>In her 1997 article on the role of singing in the Black freedom struggle, Kerran Sanger identifies four characteristics of freedom songs: </p><p>“1. Song is… a form of discourse that energizes those who engage in it and allows them to express themselves in ways not available in other forms of discourse.<br>2. Song… achieves its power from the generation, expression, and venting of intense emotion.<br>3. The powerful rhetoric of song both derives from and enhances the spirituality of those who engage in it.<br>4. As discourse, the singing of freedom songs was inherently transformative. Those who sang not only expressed themselves but were changed—made new and better—in the singing.”</p><p>The same rhetorical analysis could apply to Black protest music as a whole. Protest songs are intrinsically cathartic and spiritual for both the artist and the listener. Furthermore, protest songs convey profound, transformative messages that transcend the musical medium. However, we must also reckon with the fact that commercial music functions within a marketplace removed from the work of organizers. This project will explore such questions as: what is the relationship of Black protest music to movement-making? How does commercial protest music function within the white capitalist matrix of the music industry? Finally, what happens when art and activism intersect?</p><p>In this digital exhibit, I have curated six Black protest songs accompanied by six short essays. Each song represents a different diasporic genre (soul-jazz, gospel, rap, R&B, and rock) and responds to a distinct political moment from the last six decades. Two are particularly famous protest tracks (“Mississippi Goddam” and “Fuck Tha Police”), but the rest are lesser-known songs from influential artist-activists. Each piece of commentary will pose a guiding question and synthesize relevant scholarship with lyrical and musical analysis to understand each artist's relationship with the industry and the organizing traditions with which they align themselves. It is my hope that this project will shed some light on the sonic dimensions of Black worldmaking — past, present, and future.</p>",

        article: "Genre: Soul-jazz<p><i>How does a Black superstar navigate standing beneath the national spotlight and articulating her political beliefs? What are the ethics of profiting from protest music?</i></p><p>“Mississippi Goddam” was, in her own words, Nina Simone's “first civil rights song” and an international sensation that provoked widespread controversy about censorship in relation to the Black freedom struggle. The song brought Simone fame, fortune, and fear for her life.</p> <p>Mississippi was the most notorious state in the South for anti-Black violence and a crucial site of Black organizing throughout the 20th century. Mississippi claimed the highest number of lynchings at 581 — 50 more than Georgia and nearly 100 more than Texas. Mississippi also claimed the lives of Emmett Till, Medgar Evers, and Chaney, Goodman, and Schwermer, three COFO activists murdered during the 1964 Freedom Summer voter registration campaign (<a href='https://naacp.org/find-resources/history-explained/history-lynching-america.'>NAACP)</a></p> <p>In contrast to the straightforward delivery of the opening lines about Alabama and Tennessee, the song’s heavily syncopated hook (“Everybody knows about Mississippi”) hammers home Mississippi’s exceptional offenses. The hook is so rhythmically disorienting that the beat becomes hard to follow, which echoes Simone’s anger and confusion at the harsh realities of Black life in America (“Hound dogs on my trail / School children in jail”).</p><p>However, the song is not just a tirade against one particular state. The other key refrain, “go slow!” represents the most common critique leveled against organizers by Blacks and whites alike. Simone mocks those who urge patience (“Don't tell me, I'll tell you / Me and my people just about due... I don't trust you any more / You keep on saying 'go slow'). She also comments on the weakness of respectability politics when she complains, “You lied to me all these years / You told me to wash and clean my ears / And talk real fine just like a lady.” By the end of the song, Simone outlines a vision for the movement that prioritizes simple legal respect above costly, time-consuming social efforts like integration: “You don't have to live next to me / Just give me my equality.”</p><p>In <i>Liberated Threads</i>, Tanisha Ford broaches the subject of Simone's relatively prosperous lifestyle and how her celebrity status was deeply entangled with capitalism (Ford 2015, 37-39). Although Simone suffered censorship throughout the South and received death threats from white supremacists, protest songs like “Mississippi Goddam” also garnered her global acclaim. For instance, the recording embedded here comes from Simone's closing-act performance at the 1965 Antibes Juan-les-Pins Jazz Festival in France. I concur with Ford's view that the commercial success of  musicians like Odetta and Nina Simone should not be used to indict them — after all, Simone used her industry platform to attack systems of oppression and influence the shape of the movement. Nevertheless, Simone's example underscores the importance of evaluating artists' proximity to the work of organizers and the white capitalist matrix.</p>",

        article: "Genre: Gospel<p><i>Where does the Black Christian musical tradition intersect with the body of Black protest music? How did commercial gospel emerge as music for the movement?</i></p> <p>With its driving, bluesy bassline and insistent clapping, “Freedom Highway” thunders along and never seems to tire the ear. Each harmonized refrain rings out anew, imploring the listener to march for peace and racial justice. The song’s rhetorical power lies not in any novel melodic or rhythmic figures, but rather in its repetitive structure and the rich history behind African American spirituals.</p> <p>Modern gospel traces its roots back to the plantation era, when enslaved Black laborers joined together in singing spirituals. Converted slaves fused Christian hymns with West African musical tropes and created a vast body of group songs for work and worship. Spirituals often encoded subversive meanings and were sometimes used to organize resistance. In that sense, spirituals were the very first form of Black protest music. (Library of Congress, “<a href='https://www.loc.gov/item/ihas.200197451'>African American Song</a>”) After emancipation, spirituals retained their centrality in the Black church and continued to offer congregations solace under Jim Crow. <p>20th-century gospel choirs consolidated the spiritual tradition, adding colorful group harmonies and new lyrical material tied to contemporary issues. In his book “A City Called Heaven,” Robert Marovich narrates gospel’s commercial rise in Chicago since the Great Migration. The commodification of gospel afforded Black artists much-needed entrepreneurial opportunities, as well as an outlet to positively assert their identity amidst the contradictions of cosmopolitan life (Marovich 2015, 4-7). The Staple Singers played a pivotal role in the scene as the “First Family of Gospel,” pumping out one hit song after another with their label, Vee Jay Records (Marovich 2015, 247-49). “Freedom Highway” was perhaps more markedly political for the Staples than their early discography, but it can be understood as part of a much longer spiritual-gospel tradition grounded in faith, endurance, and protest.</p> <p>When all the other instruments are stripped away, it is clear to see that “Freedom Highway” adheres to a call-and-response structure. The call is typically improvised based on whatever the soloist is moved to sing in the moment. The response, which distinguishes one spiritual from another, is sung back by the group in solidarity with the soloist. “Freedom Highway” is structured such that the four Staple Singers take turns issuing calls and responding in harmonized unison. By utilizing this structure, the song implicitly references over two centuries of Black history and links contemporary activism with the fight against slavery. None of the lyrics are explicitly religious or messianic — in fact, the lyrics primarily grapple with finding the inner resolve to keep marching (“Made up my mind and I won't turn around”) — but perhaps it is the singers’ trust in a higher power that gives them confidence to stay the course and march “until the day is done.”</p> ",

        article: "Genre: Funk <p><i>What were the rhetorical aims of the Black Panther Party band? How do freedom fighters narrate their own musical stories?</i></p> <p>Of the six artists in this exhibit, The Lumpen were the shortest-lived and the most unique. Between 1970 and 1972, The Lumpen served as the official musical arm of the Black Panther Party. For a brief moment in time, the band’s five Panther players embodied the sound of Black Power. With a Marxist name denoting the most marginal subclass of the slumbering proletariat, The Lumpen propagated Panther ideals via a small catalog of funk songs that have largely been lost.</p> <p>“Free Bobby Now,” one of the band’s only surviving records, calls for the exoneration of BPP co-founder Bobby Seale, who was imprisoned but never convicted for playing a part in the riots at the 1968 Chicago DNC. Seale was also indicted in the murder of fellow Panther Alex Rackley, a suspected FBI informant. During this turbulent period of division and paranoia for the party, this song projected unity and refocused the movement’s attention on the causes that Seale believed in.</p> <p>So much attention has been paid to the Panthers’ politics of fashion, but we should not neglect the important role that funk music played in shaping the Panthers’ aesthetic. In <i>Liberated Threads</i>, Tanisha Ford describes how the Panthers’ sleek paramilitary uniforms and other “soul style” garments awakened college students to fashion’s discursive dimensions and more radical, class-based activism (Ford 2015, 98-102). Ford briefly touches on the relationship between soul music and Black power as exemplified by James Brown’s “Say It Loud, I’m Black and I’m Proud,” but funk’s particular impact on the era warrants further discussion.</p> <p>Drawing on James Snead’s 1981 analysis of African art traditions, Matthew Brown suggests that funk music’s circularity and flow rupture the linear, teleological Western narrative of cultural production. Hence, the genre’s use of rhythmic layering and instrumental cuts are inherently revolutionary (Brown 1994, 492-94). Lyrically, post-Civil Rights funk songs reinforced the values of Black Power by reclaiming the urban landscape and imagining the triumph of Black Americans over the “oppressor” (Morant 2011, 76-79).</p> <p>Thus, as a funk tune produced by the Panthers themselves, “Free Bobby Now” is a doubly revolutionary cultural specimen. The song fundamentally argues that Seale was innocent of the crimes brought against him (“This we know just cannot be”). Even though the Panthers cultivated an intimidating aesthetic for themselves, Seale and his peers wielded guns to defend their lineage, not to kill each other: “He carried a gun / to save his people and family / From those who’ve killed us for over four hundred years.” However, the song closes with a violent threat that is somewhat obscured by the song’s catchy, syncopated riffs and uptempo pulse. In the last verse, the singer proclaims that “the oppressor has no rights we are bound to respect.” Taken together with the line, “If we must, we’ll hold back the night,” the song ends on a tense, ominous note that seems to resonate with the BPP’s own contested legacy and internal strife.</p>",

        article: "Genre: Gangsta rap <p><i>To what extent did West Coast hip-hop reflect a violent turn in urban Black resistance? Was “Fuck Tha Police” a proto-abolitionist anthem?</i></p> <p>NWA exploded onto the hip-hop scene in 1988 with their polarizing debut album, “Straight Outta Compton.” Unlike any other mainstream rap act that had gone before, NWA introduced themselves to the world as MC Ren, “the motherfucking villain,” Easy-E, “a brother that’ll smother your mother,” and “a crazy motherfucker named Ice Cube.” They spoke about gang culture, spurned authority, objectified women, and flaunted their material possessions. In the three years that NWA’s original lineup performed together, they transformed the look of West Coast hip-hop and propelled the gangsta subgenre to the top of the national charts.</p> <p>“Fuck Tha Police” brought national attention to the racist, self-serving practices of the LA police department and its brutal treatment of gangs in South LA County. In the mid-80s, LA police chief Daryl Gates oversaw countless “gang sweeps” and the liberal use of a six-ton battering ram to lay siege to residential buildings believed to house narcotics rings (Viator 2020, 211-12). “Fuck Tha Police” was not just designed to provoke law enforcement — it also reflected a widely-held sentiment among LA residents who were fed up with aggressive policing and blamed all institutions of state power for perpetuating Black urban strife (Viator 2020, 218, 226).</p> <p>In the years since its release, “Fuck Tha Police” has only proved more prescient. From the 1992 beating of Rodney King to the 2020 murder of George Floyd, each generation has been galvanized by a shocking act of police brutality and held up this song as a timeless protest anthem. However, we ought to resist the easy temptation to imbue its lyrics with proto-abolitionist meaning. Although “Fuck Tha Police” is unapologetically explicit in its condemnation of the police state, “fucking” is distinct from “defunding” or “abolishing” the institution.</p> <p>The song is framed as a satirical trial against the police department in which each emcee testifies before Judge Dre, and the track’s mockery of court decorum could be read as an indictment of the criminal justice system. However, the song also centers on Ice Cube, Eazy-E, and Ren’s dark, retaliatory fantasies about killing cops. Ren confesses that “Takin' out a police would make my day,” and Ice Cube paints a grotesque picture of the “warpath” he would take against law enforcement if unrestrained (“a bloodbath of cops dying in LA”). All three rappers bully the police for their cowardice, accusing them of hiding behind “a badge and a gun” to conceal their crippling fear of Blackness. Modern abolitionism seeks to eradicate policing and all the interlocking systems that produce harm, which is incongruous with the violence that Ren and Ice Cube romanticize. In the world of NWA, securing justice comes second to winning back control of Compton’s streets. While this song certainly calls for an end to excessive policing and hyperbolizes the performers’ views, NWA seems to argue that in LA, war is preferable to peace.</p>",

        article: "Genre: R&B, pop <p><i>What does it mean to be a slave to the music industry? How did Prince use his platform to defy gendered, racialized norms and demand structural change?</i></p> <p>Prince’s tragic death in 2016 devastated the music community. Famous for his androgynous brand, his massive vault of unreleased songs, and his commitment to social justice, Prince made a prolific career defined by spectacle and resistance. However, prior to his passing, Prince the Artist had already died once before in a very public way.</p> <p>In 1992, Warner Brothers issued Prince a 100 million-dollar contract that he interpreted as slavery. Prince wanted to release music at his own pace and own his master recordings, but Warner Bros. severely restricted his artistic liberties. He could only release one album per year, and the contract forced him to split ownership of his very own Paisley Park label with the Warner Music Group (Billboard 2016). Prince openly chafed against Warner Bros. for meddling with his image and undermining his autonomy. The following year, he began to perform with “SLAVE” written across his cheek and opened each concert by declaring, “Prince is dead” (Fuchs 1996, 139). When Prince “died,” he changed his name to an unpronounceable symbol that rendered him/it genderless and illegible to Warner Bros. and the world. With this rebranding, the Artist formerly known as Prince unlocked a new “range of performativity” that allowed him to elude the narrow confines of the gender binary and his label’s oppressive dominion (Fuchs 1996, 139, 144).</p> <p>Prince’s metaphorical death at the hands of Warner Bros. is incredibly generative for thinking through the implications of racial capitalism. By invoking the word “slave,” Prince clearly meant to draw attention to his own race and the white capitalist matrix undergirding the music industry. Prince unraveled the interlocking threads of his oppression as a Black, gender-bending slave of the label, and in a Marxist sense, he recognized his alienation from his labor and his own identity as a performer. The Artist’s rebirth as a discursive, illegible symbol was a remarkable liberatory act: since no one could pronounce or comprehend the symbol, no one could truly own the person it named.</p> <p>“Emancipation” is the name of Prince’s first record after separating from Warner Bros and the title of the album’s closing track. The cover art proudly bears his symbol and depicts two unshackled hands, echoing the song’s resounding refrain of “Emancipation / Break the chain!” Prince lambasts the moral decay of the profit-driven industry (“Your money’s turned from green to brown”) and revels in his unbound capacity to create and consume on his own terms (“When they tell me that's enough / That's when I want to fill my cup”). Finally, just as the Emancipation Proclamation freed slaves throughout the South, we might read “Emancipation” as a call for the emancipation of all musicians from the conditions of their oppression, as well as the wholesale eradication of exploitation under capitalism.</p>",

        article: "Genre: Rock <p><i>Amidst the shifting digital landscape of movement-making, what are some ways that songwriters can directly support organizers on the ground with their music?</i></p> <p>In the wake of the police killings of Freddie Gray, Trayvon Martin, and Michael Brown, activists took to the streets, social media, and their recording studios. In 2015, Prince penned “<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMLI7LFf84w'>Baltimore</a>” as a tribute to Gray and Brown and included it on the very last album to be released during his lifetime (<i>Hit n Run Phase 2</i>). Kendrick Lamar’s conscious rap album <i>To Pimp a Butterfly</i>, which featured the instant classic “Alright,” quickly became the soundtrack of the modern Movement for Black Lives (M4BL).</p> <p>Tom Morello is the Harvard-educated son of a Kikuyu father who took part in the Mau Mau Uprising and the great-grandnephew of Jomo Kenyatta (Huffington Post 2009). Morello answered his bloodline’s revolutionary charge in his career as the lead guitarist of the left-wing rock band Rage Against the Machine (RATM). Morello wrote the iconic drop-D tuned riffs for “<a href= 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWXazVhlyxQ'>Killing in the Name Of</a>,” RATM’s breakout 1992 single that criticized the preferential treatment given to the cops who beat Rodney King: “For wearing the badge they’re the chosen whites.” At the song’s chilling climax, vocalist Zach de la Roche mumbles at first, then screams “Fuck you, I won’t do what you tell me” over and over until the beat boils over. RATM and NWA's searing anthems have only grown more relevant over the past 30 years.</p> <p>In 2014, Morello released “Marching on Ferguson,” a self-produced protest track featuring war-like drums, chanting, and his signature fusion guitar work. I chose to highlight this song not just because of Morello’s revolutionary musical background, but mainly because his deliberate, service-based approach to releasing this track exemplifies compelling methods of directly integrating protest music with movement work.</p> <p>Morello debuted “Marching on Ferguson” at a benefit concert in LA, which is one avenue that many artist-activists pursue to monetize their talents for social justice. The proceeds from this performance benefitted <a href='https://www.jailguitardoors.org/''>Jail Guitar Doors</a>, a nonprofit that rehabilitates incarcerated individuals in historically marginalized communities through musical performance (which so perfectly fits Morello’s niche as a guitarist invested in empowering victims of excessive policing). Later, Morello recorded the studio version exhibited here and released it online as part of “Ferguson October,” a month of demonstrations and political education in St. Louis that was organized primarily through social media. The track was free for anyone to download, but listeners were presented with an option to donate to help offset protestors’ legal fees (Rolling Stone, 2014).</p> <p>One unifying theme of this exhibit has been the struggle of artist-activists to orient protest music within intrinsically racialized, capitalist structures. With the free online release of “Marching On Ferguson,” Morello seems to have found an ethical, anti-commercial means of delivering social critique and servicing the movement. Digital distribution and optional, targeted donation models can enable protest music to reach an infinitely wide audience and link sympathetic listeners with a means of financially supporting activists on the ground. Morello stood to gain nothing from sharing this track, but the strength of his reputation and the quality of his music would have incentivized fans to give aid for arrested freedom fighters. While no amount of money can supplant the actual work of organizers, Morello’s example illuminates the potential for art and activism to harmoniously coexist in the digital space.</p>",
