# Album of the Revolution - Black Protest Music 1965-2014

“Name me someone who's ridiculous, Dannie.
*Governor Faubus!*
Why is he so sick and ridiculous?
*He won't permit us in his schools!*
Then he's a fool! Oh, boo!”

The lyrics to Charles Mingus’s 1959 tune “Fables of Faubus” never aired because Columbia Records refused to publish the song in its original form. Mingus recorded the piece again in 1960 with an independent label to make his scathing, satirical critique of the Ku Klux Klan and the Little Rock integration crisis heard.

“Fables” may have been an exceptionally political song for Mingus, but jazz has always been inherently political for the generations of Black practitioners upon whose shoulders the discipline rests. To that end, American popular music (read: music of the African diaspora) has consistently served as a crucial channel for Black activism spanning an array of genres and more than a century of history. For instance, Kendrick Lamar’s 2015 hip-hop anthem “Alright” was groundbreaking for the modern movement for Black lives, but critic Giovanni Russonello reminds us that the saxophone licks and rough vocals on the chorus beat descend from a long tradition of protest jazz and weaponizing the academy to demand justice (NYT 2020).

In her 1997 article on the role of singing in the Black freedom struggle, Kerran Sanger identifies four characteristics of freedom songs:
1. Song is… a form of discourse that energizes those who engage in it and allows them to express themselves in ways not available in other forms of discourse.
2. Song… achieves its power from the generation, expression, and venting of intense emotion.
3. The powerful rhetoric of song both derives from and enhances the spirituality of those who engage in it.
4. As discourse, the singing of freedom songs was inherently transformative. Those who sang not only expressed themselves but were changed—made new and better—in the singing.”

The same rhetorical analysis could apply to Black protest music as a whole. Protest songs are intrinsically cathartic and spiritual for both the artist and the listener. Furthermore, protest songs convey profound, transformative messages that transcend the musical medium. However, we must also reckon with the fact that commericial music functions within a marketplace removed from the work of organizers. This project will explore such questions as: what is the relationship of Black protest music to movement-making? How does commerical protest music function within the white capitalist matrix of the music industry? Finally, what happens when art and activism intersect?

In this digital exhibit, I have curated six Black protest songs accompanied by short essays on. Each song represents a different diasporic genre (soul-jazz, gospel, rap, R&B, and rock) and responds to a distinct political moment from the last 60 years. Two are particularly famous protest tracks (“Mississippi Goddam” and “Fuck Tha Police”), but the rest are lesser-known songs from influential artist-activists. Each piece of commentary will pose a guiding question and synthesize relevant scholarship with lyrical and musical analysis to understand each artist's relationship with the industry and the organizing traditions with which they align themselves. It is my hope that this project will shed some light on the sonic dimensions of Black worldmaking — past, present, and future.
